# Movie-Rating-project
3.	Movie Rating

Primary Goal :     This project is to develop a machine ML model that can accurately predict the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, cast, director, and budget create movies that are more likely to be successful, profitability.

Solution:   First collect a dataset of movie and preprocess and clean the data, and transform the data into machine learning models, also perform feature selection and feature engineering to determine which one performs best on the given dataset. We will use a variety of evaluation metrics, mean squared error and R-squared, to assess the performance of each model and choose the best one.

Result:    This will help movie studios to understand audience preferences and create movies that are be successful, increased revenue and profitability with accuracy 96%, precision 90%.
